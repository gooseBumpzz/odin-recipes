# odin-recipes

It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time it's finished. Building a muscle memory!
